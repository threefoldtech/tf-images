get Taiga up and running in on grid3 VM

## what in this image

- ufw with restricted rules applied.

## Building

in the grid3_taiga directory

`docker build -t {user|org}/grid3_taiga_docker:latest .`

## Deploying on grid 3

### convert the docker image to Zero-OS flist
Easiest way to convert the docker image to Flist is using [Docker Hub Converter tool](https://hub.grid.tf/docker-convert), make sure you already built and pushed the docker image to docker hub before using this tool.

### Deploying
Easiest way to deploy a VM using the flist is to head to to our [playground](https://play.grid.tf) and deploy a Virtual Machine by providing this flist URL.
* make sure to provide the correct entrypoint, and required env vars.
* another important perquisite is to have a disk mounted on `/var/lib/docker`. make sure its size is big enough to fit both the images for taiga, and the volumes which will store all the db and the media files, etc.

or use the dedicated Taiga weblet if available, which will deploy an instance that satisfies the above perquisites.

another way you could use is using our terraform plugin [docs](https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid)

here you can find a full terraform file example to deploy this flist on grid3 [link](https://github.com/threefoldtech/terraform-provider-grid/blob/development/examples/resources/taiga/main.tf) 

## Flist
### URL:
TODO: should be updated to official repo.
```
https://hub.grid.tf/samehabouelsaad.3bot/abouelsaad-grid3_taiga_docker-latest.flist
```

### Entrypoint
- `/sbin/zinit init`


### Required Env Vars
- `SSH_KEY`: User SSH public key.
- `DOMAIN_NAME`: the domain name, eg: grid3taiga.gent01.dev.grid.tf
